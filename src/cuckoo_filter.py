        To make sure the resulting H2 value lies within the range of [0, bucket_number],

        The bitmask (bucket_num - 1) effectively truncates the result of the XOR operation 
            to the number of bits required to represent bucket_num. Since num_buckets is a power of 2, 
            (num_buckets - 1) is a bitmask with all lower bits set to 1 
            (e.g., for num_buckets = 256, the bitmask is 11111111 in binary).
